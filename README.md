# wonderQ

## What I would do if I had more time

I learned a producer should hit an exchange first then go to queue

Implement features that make it so the consumer doesn't have to wait

organize it better with data models for messages and routes

implement async

different queues for different services

implement faster data structures like a map

I am not proud of this

# Things I used I want to talk about

morgan for logs

# Things to do still

dotenv to control how long before message no longer in queue

implement morgan
