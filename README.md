# wonderQ

## Introduction & business problem

## API Reference

### /API/v1/messages

This is an object representing the messages currently in the WonderQ system. Messages can be created by producers and subsequently retreived by consumers

#### Create a message

##### POST API/v1/messages

Used by producers to create messages

###### Parameters

None

###### Returns

Response code: 201

A messageID confirming the message was added to the queue successfully

##### GET API/v1/messages

Used by consumers to get the list of messages that are currently not in use by other consumers

###### Parameters

None

###### Returns

Response code: 200

A list of messageID's for the respective messages acquired by the consumer

##### DELETE API/v1/messages/:messageID

Used by consumers to inform WonderQ that they have processed the message and will delete from the queue

###### Parameters

messageID - mandatory

###### Returns

Response code: 200 if successful, 404 if messageID not provided

messageID of the specific message that was deleted from WonderQ

## What I would do if I had more time

I learned a producer should hit an exchange first then go to queue

Implement features that make it so the consumer doesn't have to wait

organize it better with data models for messages and routes

implement async

different queues for different services

morgan for logs

I am not proud of this

# Things I liked about the assignment

clever way to see how I code plus my knowledge of DS and algorithms

# Things to do still

Write documentation for your API endpoints. Talk about their inputs/outputs, formats, methods, responses, etc

â€¢ Discuss in writing (in your Github README): what steps would you need to take in order to scale this system to make it production ready for very high volume? What are potential issues in production that might arise and how would you go about implementing solutions? For each of the previous questions, which tools/technologies would you use and why? Please be detailed.

# Script for presentation

Intro: welcome to my presentation, I'm sure you have many of these to go through so I thought it would be much more fun to let you sit back and relax and let me walk you through my code and thought process. First I'll walk you through what I did and my understanding of each business requirement, then I will walk through what I know this project, lacks nad finally get into the requirements around how I would try to get this to scale for high volume, issues in production.

Walk through code from the top
Talk about timer and port

Why I used a hashmap

Things I know need to be improved when dealing with scale:
Separation of layers: controller > service layer > data access layer
role based authentication (write/read access, which queues, are you producer or consumer)
ranges based on timestamps or limits on quantity on the responses on the gets
